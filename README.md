# StockTrading
This is the project named "Stock Prediction Using Deep Reinforcement Learning."

• I worked on investigating the performance of Modern Deep Reinforcements
algorithms in the context of Stock Prediction where I compared the
performance of various Reinforcement Algorithms like QRSAC, PPO, A2C.
• The goal was to maximise the profit while minimising the risk which is measured
by Sharpe ratio.
• I integrated other advance algorithms QRSAC from NNabla-RL library to the
FinRL which helped in enhancing the performance even further. By using
QRSAC. I achieved significantly better cumulative rewards.
• I gained valuable insights into the fascinating world of financial markets and
cutting-edge applications of Deep RL, in trading strategies.
